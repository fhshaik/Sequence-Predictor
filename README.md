Uses Newton's Forward Difference Formula to predict sequences of Integers. I use Haskell along with the language of Umbral Calculus put into code in order to accomplish this. This powerful language is also good at describing sums of sequences as the discrete equivalent of Integrals. Put in an input file with a list of sequences you want to find the next number of, and it will print all of them out in a list.
